Working Process:

*This project uses Arduino to controls the motor. The Arduino Board is programmed using the Arduino IDE software.
*The Moisture Sensor measures the level of moisture in the soil and sends the signal to the Arduino if water is required.
*The motor/water pump supplies water to the plant until the desired moisture level is reached.
